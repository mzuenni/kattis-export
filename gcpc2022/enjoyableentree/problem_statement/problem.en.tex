For many days now, the canteen in Hilbert's Hotel has been offering its famous
\emph{Fibonacci Soup}. Today is the $n$th day that they offer the soup, and the
recipe changes every day:

\begin{itemize}
  \item On the first day, it is a \emph{$\pi$-tato soup}, made from a blend of local
    potato varieties, and served with onion strips and celery.
  \item On the second day, it is a \emph{$\tau$-mato soup}, consisting of
    pur\'eed tomatoes, together with carrots, onions, garlic, and basil leaves on top.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item On every day after that, the soup is made from two ingredients, the soup of the
    previous day and the soup of the day before that, mixed together in equal parts.
\end{itemize}

Find the composition of today's Fibonacci Soup.

\begin{Input}
  The input consists of:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item One line with a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{18}$), the current day.
  \end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
  Output two real numbers $\pi$ and $\tau$ ($0 \le \pi,\tau \le 100$), giving
  the percentages of $\pi$-tato soup and $\tau$-mato soup in the $n$th day's
  Fibonacci soup. Your answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative
  error is at most $10^{-6}$.
\end{Output}
