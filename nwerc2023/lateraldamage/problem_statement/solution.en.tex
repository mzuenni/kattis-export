    \begin{block}{Problem}
        Play \emph{Battleships} with a $100 \times 100$ grid
        where you need to sink up to $10$ aircraft carriers
        in at most $2500$ shots,
        and your opponent is potentially cheating (adaptive).
    \end{block}
    \pause
    \begin{block}{Observation}
        Shooting every fifth position in a straight line
        prevents your opponent from placing ships in between them.
    \end{block}
    \pause
    \begin{block}{Solution}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Generalizing this observation over two dimensions: \\
                shoot every position on every fifth diagonal line.
            \item For every hit, shoot the four positions left, right, above, and below
                to sink the full ship.
        \end{itemize}
